# PLTeamSelector
1. This is a personal project meant to help my friends and family decide what Premier League soccer team to support as I am a big fan of the league and want to introduce them to the sport.
   
2. I intended for this project to teach me front-end development basics (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). I created a wireframe for the project so I had an idea of the structure of the page from the start. I also knew I wanted to load content to the page as the user made decisions, so that is why I emphasized DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript as learning points in this project.
 
3. This is a web based project so there is no need for installation. Here is the link to the quiz. https://wonderful-figolla-fed6fe.netlify.app/

4. In the future I would like to utilize a premier league database for a larger dataset since my current dataset is small and static. I also would like to improve the matching algorithm to utilize this data set and provide more interesting results. I think I could do this with a cosine similarity algorithm potentially as my current algorithm is just based of pre-assigned weights.
